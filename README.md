# Summary

Summary
Looking at the results, there is a possible positive bias towards paid users on Amazon Vine, as there are more unpaid reviews overall, but ultimately the highest percentage of 5 stars went to paid ones ( 51% paid and 39% unpaid). This could be a first observation to give a conclusion. But if we carry out this analysis in this way, we would fall into an error since more information is needed.

Therefore, the following proposals are proposed:

One option is to develop this same analysis proposal the same analysis that we did, but for different data sets. In this analysis, it was done for video games, it could be done for clothing products or, where appropriate, accessories for children such as toys, which would allow us to have a broader panorama of product reviews.

Perhaps they behave the same or perhaps present the same tendency.

The second option is to focus a little more on this data set and look at the majority of products that shipped to paid and non-paid users, maybe for a period of time the products were actually better for paid. Thus allowing to eliminate the probability that it is something seasonal and also a much more detailed study on the actual products would be nice (although it would take more time) to confirm the 5 stars. review.
