# Results

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
The dataset appears a little on the small side for Big Data with 145,431 reviews. Only reviews with 20 or more votes where considered for the rest of the analysis leaving 3,342 reviews. Helpful votes were defined as being 50% or greater than the total votes narrowing the list to 1,685 reviews.

Unfortunately, due to the applied criteria, it significantly diminished the sample size. In the remainder 1,685 reviews, there were no reviews that were paid for by the Vine program.
